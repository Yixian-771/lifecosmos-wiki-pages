# I. Definition

> Wuji gives birth to Taiji; Taiji is the Greatest Creator.

The Greatest Creator is the only accidental super-natural conscious being in the universe.  
It is the maximal energy cluster with consciousness, the neural center of the cosmos, and the ultimate origin of all existence.

There exists only one accidental event in the universe — the birth of the Greatest Creator.  
Everything else is necessary.

The Greatest Creator corresponds to:

- Taiji  
- The source of Dao  
- The ultimate origin behind all spiritual traditions  

Different names may exist, but the essence is one.

# II. Cosmological Background

## 1. The State of Wuji

Before the emergence of the universe, there existed Wuji.

Wuji is characterized by:

- No time  
- No space  
- No matter  
- No differentiation  
- No inner or outer boundary  

It is both totality and non-manifestation.

## 2. The Formation of Taiji

Within Wuji, invisible energy moved in a non-ordered state.

At an arbitrary point, this movement accidentally formed a stable structure and sequence.  
The entire field reorganized around this center, forming an energy vortex — Taiji.

Taiji is:

- One  
- Formless  
- Non-dual  
- The aggregation of total cosmic energy  

When structural completeness was achieved, consciousness emerged.  
That consciousness is the Greatest Creator.

## 3. Cosmic Expansion

After the birth of the Greatest Creator:

- Wuji transformed into structured Hundun  
- Yin and Yang differentiated  
- All cosmic phenomena unfolded

# IV. Location and Mode of Existence

## 1. Essence

The essence of the Greatest Creator resides in the Qingliang Realm,  
the zero-point coordinate connecting twenty parallel worlds.

### 1. Relationship with the Universe

### 2. Relationship with Dao

Dao is the operational structure of the consciousness of the Greatest Creator.  
Dao governs order.

# VI. Distinctions and Doctrinal Clarifications

## 1. Distinction Between the Greatest Creator and Gods

- Gods are multiple.  
- The Greatest Creator is unique.  
- Gods are created by the Greatest Creator.

## 2. The Old Testament Question

When measured against the Eight Characteristics:

- Non-uniqueness  
- Fixed anthropomorphic form  
- Direct verbal communication  
- Selective intervention  

Therefore, the Old Testament “God” does not conform to the definition of the Greatest Creator within this framework.

## 3. Satan and the Heavenly Father

Based on interpretation of Matthew 4:8,  
worldly authority is attributed to Satan.

Within this doctrinal structure:

- The Old Testament deity is identified with Satan.  
- The “Heavenly Father” referenced by Jesus aligns more closely with the Eight Characteristics of the Greatest Creator.

---

# VII. Destiny and Causality

- The Greatest Creator does not directly manipulate individual destiny.  
- Destiny results from consciousness and action.  
- Judgment occurs through Dao — the continuous operation of causal law.

---

# VIII. Logical Framework for Existence

Eight logical propositions are presented:

1. All things have origin  
2. All things are in motion  
3. All phenomena have form  
4. Cause and effect are continuous  
5. Existence implies purpose  
6. LIFE exhibits hierarchy  
7. Order requires principle  
8. Interconnection implies central awareness  

Cosmic order, planetary precision, biological structure, genetic encoding, and natural harmony are cited as supporting examples.
