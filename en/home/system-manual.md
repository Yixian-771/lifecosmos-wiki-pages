# Lifechanyuan Encyclopedia System Manual

---

## I. Overall Positioning

The Lifechanyuan Encyclopedia is a structured knowledge system built around the Lifechanyuan philosophical framework.

Its purpose is not to publish articles, but to construct a navigable, extensible, and traceable conceptual network.

The encyclopedia prioritizes:

* Conceptual clarity
* Structural stability
* Multi-version reading layers
* Long-term evolution

It is not a promotional platform, not a forum, and not a space for emotional expression.

# Part I: Writing Protocol (Editorial Standards)

## 1. One Concept = One Root Entry

A single concept must not be duplicated across multiple parallel pages.

If duplication is discovered, editors must:

* Merge content
* Create redirects
* Remove redundant pages

Unity is prioritized over quantity.

---

## 2. Entries Are Knowledge Nodes, Not Essays

An entry exists to explain a concept.

The following are prohibited:

* Manifesto-style writing
* Slogan-based expression
* Emotional language
* Personal subjective commentary

The following are allowed:

* System-internal perspectives
* Neutral structural exposition

---

## 3. Standard Entry Structure

Every regular conceptual entry must contain the following sections (in fixed order):

1. Definition
2. Background
3. Structure
4. Core Points
5. Related Concepts
6. Further Reading

The sequence must not be altered.

---

## 4. Special Structural Entries

The following page types may contain multiple concepts:

* Overview pages
* Map pages
* Index pages
* Tag aggregation pages
* Learning path pages
* Comparative pages

These belong to the navigation system rather than single-concept entries.

---

## 5. Editorial Ethics

* Do not remove others' contributions without valid structural reason
* Preserve original meaning when editing
* Record major structural changes
* Cite sources when necessary

The encyclopedia is an explanatory system, not an opinion platform.

---

# Part II: Multi-Version Architecture

## 1. Architectural Principle

A single concept may contain multiple versions to accommodate different reading levels.

Versions are not translations. They represent different layers of conceptual depth.

---

## 2. Version Structure Per Language

Under the bilingual architecture, each concept contains three versions within each language:

* Friendly Edition (public entry layer)
* Academic Edition (research layer)
* Internal Edition (system core layer)

Recommended production order:

Internal → Academic → Friendly

Recommended display order:

Friendly → Academic → Internal

---

## 3. Path Structure Example

Chinese structure:

```
/zh/concept-name
/zh/concept-name/friendly
/zh/concept-name/academic
/zh/concept-name/internal
```

English structure:

```
/en/slug
/en/slug/friendly
/en/slug/academic
/en/slug/internal
```

The portal page provides navigation only and does not contain full content.

---

# Part III: Tag Standard System

## 1. Tag Usage Rules

Each entry must:

* Have at least one thematic tag
* Optionally include one type tag
* Contain no more than three tags total
* Use only officially defined tags
* Never create new tags without protocol approval

Tags function as knowledge coordinates, not keywords.

* #Humanity-System

# Part IV: Five Core Operating Protocols

## Protocol 1: Tag Rule

Fixed format:

1 thematic tag + 1 type tag + optional 1 direction tag
Maximum 3 tags.

---

## Protocol 2: Bilingual Linking Rule

Chinese pages link only to Chinese pages.
English pages link only to English pages.

Language is an entry point, not a structural division.

---

## Protocol 3: Entry Numbering System

Each entry has a hidden ID:

LC-0001
LC-0002

Used for:

* Database ordering
* Duplicate prevention
* Version traceability

The ID is not displayed publicly.

---

## Protocol 4: Internal Linking Standard

All internal links must use:

```
[[Entry Name]]
```

Hard URLs are not permitted.

The encyclopedia is a network, not a directory.

---

## Protocol 5: Writing Style Standard

Must be:

* Structured
* Clearly defined
* Explainable
* Traceable

Must not be:

* Promotional
* Emotional
* Slogan-driven

Each section should answer three questions:

What is it?
How does it operate?
Why does it exist?

---

# Closing Statement

The goal of the encyclopedia is not completion, but continuous growth.

Structure ensures freedom.
Rules protect the future.

This is an evolvable knowledge system.
