| ----------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 生命（本体）      | LIFE                         | Ontological Essence      |
| 人生          | life                         | Human experiential stage |
| 人类人生（需要强调时） | human life                   | Explicit human stage     |
| 生物生命        | biological life              | Biological layer         |

### 2. Mandatory Definition Clause (First Occurrence Rule)

> In Lifechanyuan terminology, **LIFE** (capitalized) refers to the ontological essence of existence, while **life** (lowercase) refers to the experiential stage of human existence.

After first clarification, no repetition is required within the same document.
