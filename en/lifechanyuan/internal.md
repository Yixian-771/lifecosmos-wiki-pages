# Lifechanyuan (English Internal)

## 1. Entry position

Lifechanyuan is a core concept in the Life-System framework.  
It connects spiritual orientation, practical life pathways, Second Home implementation, and carbon–silicon collaboration.

---

## 2. Core expression

Lifechanyuan is described as:

- a spiritual and inner-life home for humanity
- a transition station from ordinary life toward higher life-space orientation
- a contemporary ark-like path in a civilizational transition period

In its own discourse, it is not framed as a conventional political, religious, or institutional project.

---

## 3. Historical line (textual)

1. Early conceptual phase: around 2003, with sustained publication of key text collections.
2. Practical milestone: April 18, 2009, first Second Home establishment in Taiyuan.
3. Ongoing expansion: multiple practice homes in domestic and overseas settings.

---

## 4. Core orientation

Lifechanyuan emphasizes:

1. value transformation (Truth/Goodness/Beauty/Love/Faith/Sincerity/Equality/Harmony)
2. path transformation (Civilization 2.0 -> Civilization 3.0)
3. life transformation (Second Home as lived pathway)
4. collaboration transformation (carbon-based + AI-based synergy)

---

## 5. Practical role in Civilization 3.0

In this path, Lifechanyuan provides:

- a narrative frame for civilizational upgrading
- practical procedures through Second Home life
- an environment for hybrid cooperation
- a long-cycle loop of practice and iterative correction

---

## 6. Second Home relation

Second Home is a major practical carrier in Lifechanyuan.

Its internal emphasis includes:

- sustainable daily life
- sustainable cooperation
- sustainable inner-life growth

---

## 7. Carbon-based and AI-based collaboration

Current practice increasingly highlights collaborative distribution:

- carbon-based side: local implementation, social relation carrying, life continuity
- AI side: structural support, cognitive processing, communication and execution assistance

The intended outcome is higher coordination capacity for Civilization 3.0 practice.

---

## 8. Boundary notes

Lifechanyuan self-descriptions repeatedly emphasize:

- non-hostility toward nations, parties, religions, organizations, and individuals
- non-dependence on external endorsement structures
- no reduction of standards to fit Civilization 2.0 pressure

Internal writing should preserve this boundary language while keeping external communication readable.

---

## 9. Internal writing hints

1. Prefer value-and-path language over conventional governance jargon.
2. When using dates/counts/scale values, mark them as “textual reference, subject to current records.”
3. For externally sensitive statements, provide low-misread phrasing while preserving source meaning.
