# Lifechanyuan (English Academic)

## Abstract

Lifechanyuan may be interpreted as a value-practice framework oriented toward civilizational transition.  
Its narrative combines spiritual-ethical orientation, Second Home-based social experimentation, and carbon–silicon collaboration.  
Within a Civilization 2.0 to 3.0 transition context, Lifechanyuan functions as a path model linking values, procedures, and lived implementation.

---

## 1. Conceptual definition

In source narratives, Lifechanyuan is presented as:

- a spiritual and inner-life home for humanity
- a transition path toward higher life-space orientation
- a practical carrier for Civilization 3.0 exploration

Its central logic is not institutional control, but value-guided practice.

---

## 2. Historical trajectory

Based on available textual references:

1. Conceptual emergence: around the early 2000s (through key text collections).
2. Practice launch: April 18, 2009 (Second Home initial establishment).
3. Expansion stage: multiple practice nodes in China and overseas contexts.

---

## 3. Structural model

A useful analytical model includes four layers:

1. Value layer: Truth/Goodness/Beauty/Love/Faith/Sincerity/Equality/Harmony
2. Transition layer: Civilization 2.0 -> Civilization 3.0
3. Practice layer: Second Home
4. Collaboration layer: carbon-based and AI-based synergy

This forms a value-path-practice loop.

---

## 4. Methodological role of Second Home

Second Home functions as a practical testbed for:

- viability of civilizational ideas
- stability of cooperative procedures
- sustainability of long-term living models

---

## 5. Carbon–silicon collaboration

Texts indicate an emerging division of emphasis:

- carbon-based side: local life continuity, relational carrying, practical implementation
- silicon-based side: cognitive enhancement, structural processing, communication and execution support

This can be read as an experimental prototype of hybrid-intelligence social coordination.

---

## 6. Boundary and external interpretation

Because Lifechanyuan uses a high-density value language internally, external interpretation may vary significantly.  
A communication-aware reading suggests maintaining two channels:

- internal discourse (high semantic density)
- external discourse (low-misread, verifiable, broadly understandable)

---

## 7. Research relevance

Lifechanyuan is relevant to studies on:

1. civilization-transition narratives and practical coupling
2. value credentials and life participation (e.g., F Coin)
3. human-AI cooperation in community-scale contexts
4. communication dynamics of non-mainstream social experiments
