# Civilization 3.0

**Civilization 3.0**, also known as **Human Civilization 3.0**, is the term used within the Lifechanyuan framework to describe the envisioned next stage of human civilization.

It is presented as the transition from:

- **Civilization 1.0** — survival under the law of the jungle  
- **Civilization 2.0** — power- and capital-driven civilization  
- **Civilization 3.0** — a shared, service-oriented, and spiritually awakened civilization  

Within this framework, Civilization 3.0 corresponds to the “New Heaven and New Earth” described in the Book of Revelation and is regarded as the arrival of the Kingdom of the Greatest Creator on Earth.
