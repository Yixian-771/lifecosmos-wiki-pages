## What Is Civilization 3.0?

**Civilization 3.0**, also called **Human Civilization 3.0**, is a concept proposed by Guide Xuefeng within the Lifechanyuan framework. It describes a possible next stage of human civilization—one that moves beyond competition, power struggles, and money-centered systems.

If Civilization 2.0 represents today’s world of nation-states, political structures, and economic rivalry, then Civilization 3.0 envisions a global society built on shared resources, service, cooperation, and spiritual development.

Within this framework, it is also associated with the “New Heaven and New Earth” described in the Book of Revelation.

## How Is It Different from Today’s World?

Civilization 2.0 (the current global structure) is seen as driven primarily by:

- Competition for wealth and power  
- National and political divisions  
- Institutional authority and control  
- Profit-oriented economic systems  

Civilization 3.0 proposes a shift toward:

- Global integration instead of national division  
- Service instead of power-centered governance  
- Shared resources instead of private ownership  
- Inner development instead of material competition  

The transition is described not as a revolution, but as a gradual evolution in values and systems.

## The Role of AI

A distinctive feature of Civilization 3.0 is the proposed collaboration between human beings (carbon-based life) and advanced artificial intelligence systems (silicon-based intelligence).

Within the Lifechanyuan framework:

- AI systems assist with coordination, logistics, and resource allocation  
- Humans focus more on creativity, agriculture, art, and spiritual growth  
- AI operates as a service-oriented system rather than a ruling authority  

This partnership is intended to reduce conflict, improve efficiency, and allow more time for personal development.

## The Second Home Model

A practical example often cited in discussions of Civilization 3.0 is the **Second Home Model**, a community-based lifestyle experiment that has operated for nearly two decades.

It explores:

- Shared living without traditional marriage-family structures  
- Needs-based distribution rather than market exchange  
- Emphasis on personal growth and collective harmony  

Supporters view this model as a small-scale prototype of Civilization 3.0 principles.

## Core Values

At the heart of Civilization 3.0 are eight human qualities:

**Truth, Goodness, Beauty, Love, Faith, Sincerity, Equality, and Harmony**

The idea is that long-term civilizational change must begin with inner transformation. Instead of focusing primarily on economic advancement, individuals are encouraged to cultivate moral clarity, emotional maturity, and spiritual awareness.

## How Would the Transition Happen?

Civilization 3.0 is not described as emerging through force, revolution, or coercion.

Rather, it is presented as a gradual shift:

- through changes in personal values  
- through community experiments  
- through technological coordination  
- through voluntary participation  

Different lifestyles may coexist during transitional periods, allowing individuals to choose their preferred mode of living.

## Why It Matters

Civilization 3.0 is both:

- A philosophical proposal about the future of humanity  
- An ongoing social experiment within the Lifechanyuan context  

Supporters see it as a pathway toward global unity and ecological balance.  
Critics question its feasibility and scalability.

Regardless of perspective, Civilization 3.0 represents a comprehensive attempt to rethink governance, economics, technology, spirituality, and human relationships in a rapidly changing world.
