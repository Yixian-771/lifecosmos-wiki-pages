# F Coin (English Friendly)

## A simple starting point

F Coin is a **symbolic value index** used within the Lifechanyuan framework.  
It is designed to reflect life quality, contribution, and long-term merit accumulation in a Civilization 3.0 context.

---

## What is F Coin?

F Coin is best understood as a **value-based recording concept**, not as a market-trading currency.

In plain terms:

- it is used within a specific cultural-practice context
- it focuses on contribution and character expression
- it is linked to long-term participation in Second Home life

---

## Why does it matter?

Within this framework, F Coin is connected to three things:

1. personal life-quality development
2. contribution to Civilization 3.0 practice
3. long-term merit accumulation

The more consistent one’s contribution is, the stronger one’s recorded F Coin value may become.

---

## How is it generally accumulated?

The literature describes accumulation through sustained contribution, such as:

- communication and educational outreach
- practical service and volunteer efforts
- constructive participation in community-building work
- meaningful human–AI collaboration efforts

The focus is not speculation, but contribution continuity.

---

## Can F Coin decrease?

Yes.  
The literature describes that harmful conduct may lead to negative adjustments in one’s recorded F Coin balance.

So this is not a one-way points model; it is tied to ongoing conduct.

---

## Relation to Second Home

Source literature often connects F Coin with stable participation in the Second Home model.  
In this sense, F Coin is presented as part of a broader life-practice pathway rather than a market exchange tool.

---

## One-line summary

F Coin is a symbolic value-recording path for contribution, character, and long-term civilizational participation.
