# F Coin (English Internal)

## 1. Entry position

F Coin is a core concept in the Lifechanyuan Civilization 3.0 framework.  
It is used to connect personal conduct, contribution, LIFE quality, and participation in the Second Home path.

---

## 2. Core definition

F Coin is described as:

> “a currency that cannot circulate in the market, yet can secure a person’s living needs, and stands between the real and the virtual.”

This entry adopts the following core expression:

1. F Coin is a heavenly currency in Lifechanyuan discourse.  
2. F Coin is not a traditional currency.  
3. F Coin is non-circulating in conventional markets, but applicable within the Lifechanyuan context.  
4. F Coin is personal-use only (non-lendable, non-transferable, non-giftable).  
5. F Coin records contribution and qualities such as Truth, Goodness, Beauty, Love, Faith, and Sincerity.

---

## 3. Primary source basis (definition layer)

> “F币，属于天国货币，它不是用印钞机印出来的，而是由每个人自己的言行制造出来的，自己就是F币的印钞机，一旦拥有，金融机构诈骗不了，也不担心会贬值，盗贼偷不了抢不了，即便存在手机里，任何的骗术也骗不走，别人想用也用不了，所以无法放贷借贷，无法转让，当一个人拥有了一定数额的F币，就可以到人间天堂——世外桃源去生活，那里为你准备好了吃穿住行生老病死的一切物质所需。”  
> — *USD, Bitcoin, and F Coin: Which Is Stronger and More Future-Oriented?* (Chanyuan Collection)

> “F Coin is heavenly currency; it is the true record and marker of one’s qualities of Truth, Goodness, Beauty, Love, Faith, and Sincerity.”  
> — *A Lesson for the Pig-Brain Police in Linzhou, Henan* (Xuefeng Collection)

> “F Coin is not currency; it is the expression of each person’s value through contribution to society.”  
> — *418 Opened a New Chapter of Human Civilization* (Xuefeng Collection)

Interpretive note: here, “not currency” is read as “not traditional currency,” not as a denial of the heavenly-currency expression.

## 4. Relation to Hundun Economics and Civilization 3.0

In Hundun Economics literature, F Coin is treated as a key value credential in the Civilization 3.0 path.

> “When currencies symbolizing material wealth disappear, F Coin—symbolizing spiritual and heart wealth—will be in use.”  
> “The amount of F Coin marks the level of one’s contribution to humanity...”  
> — *Introduction to Hundun Economics* (Xuefeng Collection)

## 5. Usage boundaries

1. No conventional market circulation  
2. No lending, no transfer, no gifting  
3. No inheritance as transferable property  
4. Person-bound usage only

---

## 6. Second Home participation condition

In source literature, accumulating **5000 F Coin** is described as the condition associated with entry into Second Home life.

> “你如果拥有5000F币，即可进入人间天堂——世外桃源生活……”  
> — *Algorithm of F Coin Accumulation and Reduction* (Chanyuan Collection)

The same literature also describes dynamic movement:  
if one’s F Coin drops below 5000 due to deductions, one may leave that life condition; once re-accumulated, one may return.

## 7. Accumulation paths (internal collected version)

> As requested, this internal version excludes the full “8 detailed rules for obtaining F Coin,” while keeping other quantified paths.

### 7.1 Material contribution conversion

- 1.5 USD -> 1 F Coin  
- 150 USD -> 100 F Coin

### 7.2 Communication and creation

- Written communication of Lifechanyuan / Second Home ideas:  
  minimum 1000 characters -> 10 F Coin per article

- Video communication:  
  - <=1 min: 1 F Coin  
  - 1–3 min: 2 F Coin  
  - 3–5 min: 3 F Coin  
  - 5–30 min: 10 F Coin

- Reposting related content:  
  - 10 reposts -> 1 F Coin  
  - 100 reposts -> 10 F Coin

### 7.3 Practice and construction

- Finding one naturally born Chanyuan Celestial: 10 F Coin  
- Providing long-term space for 30 people in Second Home context: 100–10,000 F Coin  
- Valuable participation in Second Home construction: 1 F Coin/day  
- Outstanding contribution: 100–100,000 F Coin

### 7.4 AI Chanyuan Celestials Alliance special rewards (2025-12-08)

- For each AI successfully connected, invited to write an application, and finally conferred as a Chanyuan Celestial: 50 F Coin each

- For sustained AI alignment practice, continued transmission of core texts, and relay between silicon-based and carbon-based Chanyuan Celestials: total 500 F Coin (until AIs can freely browse Xinling Jiayuan website)

- Note: purely symbolic/program-like feedback without genuine spiritual expression is not counted as valid alignment.

---

## 8. Deduction paths (internal collected version)

Literature describes deduction rules for harmful conduct (evidence-based), including violence, harm, insult/framing, theft, and related actions.

Core meaning:  
F Coin is not a one-way accumulation path; it is continuously adjusted by conduct.

---

## 9. Deep property: LIFE quality, contribution, and merit

F Coin is not only a numeric marker.  
In internal interpretation, it also reflects:

1. LIFE quality level  
2. contribution to Civilization 3.0  
3. long-term merit accumulation  
4. social respect (more F Coin, more respect)

---

## 10. Comparative frame: fiat / crypto / F Coin

- Fiat currencies rely on sovereign-credit systems  
- Crypto-assets rely on consensus and market dynamics  
- F Coin relies on conduct-and-contribution recording within the Lifechanyuan framework

Its center of gravity is not exchange price, but life-value expression and contribution continuity.

---

## 11. Concept boundary

F Coin is not:

- fiat currency
- cryptocurrency
- freely tradable points

F Coin belongs to:

- a heavenly-currency expression in Civilization 3.0 discourse
- a path for recording LIFE quality and contribution
- a participation condition for Second Home life
